Basic MultiSig Wallet API
Our Basic Multi-Signature addresses by default require two signatures for all withdrawals: yours, and Block.io's. This method provides exponentially higher security for your Wallets and applications than single-signature addresses. This way, you spend coins yourself, without trusting Block.io with your credentials. For private keys for your wallets, visit the Settings page on your dashboard.

If you require a more elaborate configuration to customize your applications' security, inquire about our Distributed Trust framework by going here. This framework allows up to 5 signatures per address. The use cases are endless!

Getting Started
First, you will need your API Keys, which we provide for Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and their Testnets. These API Keys are located in your Wallet. You are required to use an API Key when you interact with Block.io. It tells Block.io which network (e.g., Bitcoin) you wish to perform actions on.

You can access the API by making calls to links of this format:

Actions for Handling Addresses
Get New Address
Returns a newly generated address, and its unique(!) label generated by Block.io. You can optionally specify a custom label.
You can also optionally specify the type of address you wish to generate.

 Available address types for Bitcoin, and Litecoin are P2SH (9ssLTc6WJvx8KxgR21a5XHrZPmUo2gdWbc), and WITNESS_V0. Dogecoin is limited to P2SH addresses at this time.

Note that use of Witness v0 addresses will save you significant amounts of network fees, but these addresses are very new, and users' wallets may not recognize them at this time.

Withdrawal Actions
Overview
Block.io eases your burden of storing information regarding users' addresses, labels, and user IDs. Below, we provide various methods that allow you to make fine-grained withdrawals from your account(s). You can withdraw from any addresses, from specific addresses, from specific user ids, and from specific labels, and you can send the specified amounts to up to 2500 destination addresses, users, or labels in a single API call.

Minimum Amounts You can withdraw at least 2 DOGE, 0.00002 BTC, or 0.0002 LTC.

Block.io Fees Block.io does not charge fees (except on the Viking Plan). You always pay your own network fees, however, which are in addition to the withdrawal amounts specified.

Network Fees The speed with which miners confirm your transaction depends on the network fees you pay, and the network fees you pay depend on the size of your transaction (in bytes). Larger transactions incur higher network fees. You can specify the priority for your transactions using an additional parameter priority={low,medium,high,custom} to adjust the network fee you wish to pay. Block.io will adjust appropriate network fees for priority={low,medium,high} automatically by monitoring the state of the relevant network. You can specify custom network fees using the parameters priority=custom and custom_network_fee=CUSTOM_NETWORK_FEE.

Transaction Batching You can send coins to upto 2500 destination addresses in a single transaction. We recommend using a single transaction to send coins to multiple recipients, wherever possible. This allows you to incur lower network fees overall, improves confirmation times for your transactions, as well as the health of the relevant network and its blockchain.

Ensuring Uniqueness of Withdrawals Client-side human or machine error can lead to multiple executions of the same withdrawal request. If such an error occurs, you will lose money. To ensure the uniqueness of withdrawal requests, you can specify a nonce=value parameter with your withdrawal requests, where value is an alpha-numeric string between 1 and 64 characters long. Withdrawal requests that provide duplicate nonces less than 1 hour apart will be rejected. This is an optional but recommended security measure.

Missing "reference_id" Errors Executing transactions simultaneously may result in two or more transactions that attempt to spend the same coins (inputs). Since an input can only be spent once, you will see a "missing reference_id" error. To avoid this pitfall, your code must make sure all withdrawal requests are performed in a mutually exclusive manner, meaning a transaction must be created and signed before another transaction is attempted.

These methods support POST and GET, but only GET examples are shown below. We recommend using POST methods in your applications.

 Please use one of our official libraries for Ruby, PHP, NodeJS, Python, or C# to perform client-side signatures. You can always make your own client-side signature libraries using these instructions: Client-Side Signing for Withdrawals.

Withdraw
Withdraws amount of coins from any addresses in your account to up to 2500 destination addresses.

Withdraw From Labels

 The amounts=AMOUNT1,AMOUNT2,... and to_addresses=ADDRESS1,ADDRESS2,... parameters specify that destination ADDRESS1 will receive AMOUNT1, ADDRESS2 will receive AMOUNT2, etc. The source addresses (from_addresses=...) will need at least SUM(AMOUNT1,AMOUNT2...)+Network Fees in balances for this withdrawal to succeed.

Estimate Network Fee
Estimates the Network Fee you will need to pay when you make a withdrawal request. The Network Fee is required by the Bitcoin/Dogecoin/etc. networks, not Block.io.

 When you change withdrawal parameters, the estimated network fees or lower/upper bounds for custom network fee may change as well.

 Please use the same parameters as you would with any withdrawal API call; only one example is given below.

Address Archival Actions
Archiving of addresses help you control account bloat due to a large number of addresses.

When an address is archived, it is:

Not displayed in your wallet dashboard.
Not included in the get_my_addresses API call.
Not used to get available account balance.
Not used as a withdrawal address, unless specified.
Address archival can greatly enhance the operational security of your applications by allowing you to move coins to new addresses without clogging your API call responses.

 As of 07/04/2020, addresses that receive coins (other than from your own account's addresses) will be unarchived automatically.

Archive Addresses
Archives upto 100 addresses in a single API call. Addresses can be specified by their labels.

Misc. Actions
Get Current Price
Returns the prices from the largest exchanges for Bitcoin, Dogecoin, or Litecoin, specified by the API Key. Specifying the base currency is optional.


/api/v2/get_current_price/?api_key=6b50-6473-a9b0-454c/api/v2/get_current_price/?api_key=6b50-6473-a9b0-454c&price_base=BASE CURRENCY

 Get current price of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, or Litecoin in all base currencies
 Get current price of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, or Litecoin in a given base currency
Get Transactions
Returns various data for the last 25 transactions spent or received. You can optionally specify a before_tx parameter to get earlier transactions.

 You can use this method to query for addresses that are not on your account.

 Each result provides a confidence rating that shows the network's belief in the transaction's viability. This is useful if you need to validate transactions quickly (for e.g., in retail store settings) without waiting for confirmations. We recommend waiting for confidence ratings to reach 0.90-0.99 for unconfirmed transactions if you need to validate it. For unconfirmed transactions, you are also provided with the number of nodes (propagated_by_nodes) on the Network that approve of the given unconfirmed transaction (out of 150 sampled nodes).

 If a double spend is detected for an unconfirmed transaction, its confidence rating falls to 0.0.
