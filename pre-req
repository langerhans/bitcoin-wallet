PREREQUISITES FOR BUILDING
You'll need git, a Java 8 SDK (or later) and Gradle 4.4 (or later) for this. We'll assume Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) for the package installs, which comes with OpenJDK 8 and Gradle 4.4.1 out of the box.

# first time only
sudo apt install git gradle openjdk-8-jdk
Create a directory for the Android SDK (e.g. android-sdk) and point the ANDROID_HOME variable to it.

Download the Android SDK Tools and unpack it to $ANDROID_HOME/.

Finally, the last preparative step is acquiring the source code. Again in your workspace, use:

# first time only
git clone -b master https://github.com/bitcoin-wallet/bitcoin-wallet.git bitcoin-wallet
cd bitcoin-wallet
BUILDING
You can build all sub-projects in all flavors at once using Gradle:

# each time
gradle clean build
For details about building the wallet see the specific README.

BINARIES
