BITCOIN WALLET
Welcome to Bitcoin Wallet, a standalone Bitcoin payment app for your Android device!

This project contains several sub-projects:

wallet: The Android app itself. This is probably what you're searching for.
market: App description and promo material for the Google Play app store.
integration-android: A tiny library for integrating Bitcoin payments into your own Android app (e.g. donations, in-app purchases).
sample-integration-android: A minimal example app to demonstrate integration of Bitcoin payments into your Android app.
PREREQUISITES FOR BUILDING
You'll need git, a Java 8 SDK (or later) and Gradle 4.4 (or later) for this. We'll assume Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) for the package installs, which comes with OpenJDK 8 and Gradle 4.4.1 out of the box.

# first time only
sudo apt install git gradle openjdk-8-jdk
Create a directory for the Android SDK (e.g. android-sdk) and point the ANDROID_HOME variable to it.

Download the Android SDK Tools and unpack it to $ANDROID_HOME/.

Finally, the last preparative step is acquiring the source code. Again in your workspace, use:

# first time only
git clone -b master https://github.com/bitcoin-wallet/bitcoin-wallet.git bitcoin-wallet
cd bitcoin-wallet
BUILDING
You can build all sub-projects in all flavors at once using Gradle:

# each time
gradle clean build
For details about building the wallet see the specific README.

BINARIES
You can install the app from the app store of your choice:

Testnet: F-Droid | Google Play
